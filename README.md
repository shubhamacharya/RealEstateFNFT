# Fractional NFT for Real Estate (WIP)

## **Introduction**
Fractional NFTs (F-NFTs) enable the division of real estate ownership into digital shares represented by NFTs, making real estate investment accessible to a broader audience. This project leverages blockchain technology to tokenize real estate, allowing multiple investors to own fractions of a property securely and efficiently.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend:** React (part of MERN stack)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js (part of MERN stack)
- **Database:** MongoDB (part of MERN stack)
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity
- **API:** GraphQL

## **Project Features**

### 1. **Tokenization of Real Estate**
   - Real estate ownership rights are encoded as NFTs using Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity.

### 2. **Fractional Ownership**
   - NFTs are fractionalized, allowing multiple investors to co-own a property by purchasing fractions of an NFT.

### 3. **Investment Pool**
   - Investors pool funds to acquire property shares represented by fractional NFTs.

### 4. **Revenue Distribution**
   - Rental income and property appreciation are distributed among NFT holders according to their ownership percentage.

### 5. **Decentralized Governance**
   - Investors participate in platform governance through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) using their tokens.

### 6. **Web 3.0 Integration**
   - The project bridges real-world assets with Web 3.0, enabling seamless digital ownership and transfer of real estate shares.

## **How It Works**

1. **Tokenization:**
   - Property ownership is minted as an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.
   
2. **Fractionalization:**
   - The NFT is locked in a vault and divided into fungible tokens representing fractional ownership.

3. **Investment & Ownership:**
   - Investors purchase these tokens through the platform, gaining fractional ownership.

4. **Revenue Management:**
   - Revenue generated from the property is automatically distributed to token holders.

## **Benefits of Fractional NFTs in Real Estate**

- **Lower Entry Barrier:**
  - Allows small-scale investors to enter the real estate market with minimal capital.
  
- **Stress-Free Management:**
  - Eliminates the traditional hassles of real estate management by digitizing ownership and transactions.
  
- **Decentralization:**
  - Empowers investors with governance rights over the platform.

- **Security & Transparency:**
  - Blockchain ensures tamper-proof and traceable ownership records.

- **Ease of Transfer:**
  - Ownership can be transferred easily by selling NFTs.

## **Conclusion**
The "Fractional NFT for Real Estate" project aims to revolutionize real estate investment by leveraging the MERN stack, Ethereum, Solidity, and GraphQL. It provides a secure, accessible, and decentralized platform for fractional ownership of real estate.
